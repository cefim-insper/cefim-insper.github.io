blurb: "We investigate the impact of firm characteristics on stock returns in the Brazilian financial market, considering a long list of characteristics found be relevant in the U.S. market. Employing Fama-MacBeth regressions, alongside machine learning techniques, we examine over 24 firm-level characteristics. Our findings highlight the stronger influence of price-related metrics, such as momentum, liquidity, size and volatility, over accounting variables."
